Install the latest version of npm. This will be useful when running all the build commands. Run the following in a command line, either your IDE's Terminal window or in a Windows Command Prompt.

    npm install --global npm@latest
                                                            
                                                        
Install the app dependencies by running the following command in the command line inside the folder root where you have unzipped the theme package archive.
You can also use yarn to install dependencies instead of npm.


    npm install
                                                        
After npm finishes installing the modules from package.json you can go ahead and start the application. To do so, run the command below.

    node index.js
